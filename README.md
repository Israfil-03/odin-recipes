# Odin Recipes

This project is a simple website created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. It features a main index page with links to a few recipes.

## About

This project demonstrates basic HTML skills, including creating lists, adding images, and linking to other pages. Each recipe page includes an image, a description, a list of ingredients, and the steps to prepare the dish.

## Recipes Included

*   Paneer Butter Masala
*   Aloo Paratha
*   Veg Pulao

## How to View

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Open the `odin-recipes` folder.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## File Structure

The project has a straightforward structure:

*   `index.html`: The main page.
*   `Recipes/`: A folder containing the HTML files for each recipe.
*   `assets/`: A folder containing the images used in the project.

This project is a practical exercise in creating a multi-page static website and understanding relative paths for linking pages and images.
