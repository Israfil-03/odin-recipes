    <p>
      Paneer Butter Masala, also known as Paneer Makhani, is one of India's most
      beloved vegetarian curries. This quintessential North Indian dish features
      soft, succulent cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) simmered in a
      rich, velvety, and mildly sweet tomato-based gravy. The sauce gets its
      signature creaminess from a blend of cashews and cream, while a medley of
      aromatic spices like garam masala and kasuri methi (dried fenugreek
      leaves) lends it a complex, irresistible flavor. Finished with a generous
      knob of butter, this dish is a true indulgence for the senses, perfect for
      pairing with warm naan bread or fluffy basmati rice.
