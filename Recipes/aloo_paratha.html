    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt. Gradually add
        water and knead to form a soft, pliable dough. Add a little oil or ghee
        and knead again until absorbed. Cover the dough and let it rest for at
        least 20-30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil the potatoes until they are completely done. Once cooled, peel the
        potatoes and mash them thoroughly. Add the chopped green chilies, chili
        powder, garam masala, dry mango powder, fresh coriander, and salt to the
        mashed potatoes. Mix all the ingredients gently until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the rested dough and potato filling into equal-sized balls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly. Roll it into a small disc,
        about 4-5 inches in diameter. Place a portion of the potato filling in
        the center of the rolled dough. Bring the edges of the dough together
        over the stuffing and seal the filling. Gently flatten the stuffed ball
        with your fingers to spread the filling evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dust the stuffed dough ball with flour and carefully roll it out into a
        round paratha of your desired thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a tawa (griddle) over medium heat. Once hot, place a rolled
        paratha on the tawa. Cook for about a minute or two until the base is
        partially cooked. Flip the paratha and apply oil or ghee on the cooked
        side. Flip again and apply oil or ghee on the other side. Press gently
        with a spatula and cook until both sides have golden brown spots.
      </li>
    </ol>
