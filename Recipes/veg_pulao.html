      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
      <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the Basmati rice 2-3 times until the water runs clear. Soak the
        rice in water for 20-30 minutes. Drain thoroughly before cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat ghee or oil in a deep pan or pot over medium heat. Add the whole
        spices (cumin seeds, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods,
        cloves). Sauté for a few seconds until they become fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn translucent and lightly
        golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add all the chopped mixed vegetables and sauté for 2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently add the drained Basmati rice to the pan. Mix gently with the
        vegetables and spices for 1-2 minutes. Add chopped coriander leaves.
      </li>
      <li>Pour in the water and add salt to taste. Stir gently.</li>
      <li>
        Bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to
        low, cover the pan tightly with a lid, and let it cook for 15-20
        minutes, or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked
        through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the pulao rest, covered, for
        5-10 minutes. Gently fluff the pulao with a fork before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
